About eMammal

eMammal is a data management system and archive for camera trap research projects.  This cyber-tool is designed to not only be useful to scientists, but also to the citizen scientists who aid scientists in photo collection.  Camera trappers use our software to look at pictures, identify animals and upload them for review and archive at the Smithsonian.
